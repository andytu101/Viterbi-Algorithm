Part 1 Objective: Complete the decoder Verilog starter files to make it run successfully on the test bench (viterti_tx_rx_tb.sv). For the first part, I disabled error injection in the channel (in viterbi_tx_rx1.sv) which connects the encoder output to the decoder input. I completed the decoder.sv and its submodules. 


Part 1 deliverables (in the document "Viterbi Algorithm"): 
1) The Questa/ModelSim transcript, and proof of synthesis (either Quartus RTL viewer diagram or Mentor Precision netlist text, plus utilization report). Transcript will show your score / 256 trials. 
2) Explain how this encoder works. Use this encoder with the decoder.
3) Explain how the decoder works and show that the minimum branch metric = 0 when no errors are present. How does the decoder determine what sequence of bits was sent to the encoder?

path cost(i)  = path metric(i) + branch metric(i)

valid_o = 0 | selection = 0 | path cost = 0
valid_o = 0 | selection = 1 | path cost = 0
valid_o = 1 | selection = 0 | path cost = path_cost_0
valid_o = 1 | selection = 1 | path cost = path_cost_1

valid_o = 0 if neither path valid


path_o_valid = 0 | path_1_valid = 0 | selection = 0
path_o_valid = 0 | path_1_valid = 1 | selection = 1
path_o_valid = 0 | path_1_valid = 0 | selection = 0
path_o_valid = 1 | path_1_valid = 1 | selection = *

*: 1 if path_cost_0 larger than path_cost_1; else 0


Branch Metric Computation Blocks
There 8 modules, identical except as noted here: 

tmp00 = rx_pair[0]; tmp01 = rx_pair[1]
  exception: for bmc 1,2,5, and 6, invert rx_pair[1] in the above expression

tmp10 = !tmp00     tmp 11  = !tmp01

path_0_bmc[1] = tmp00 & tmp01   
       path_0_bmc[0] = tmp00 ^ tmp01
  same for path_1_bmc with tmp10 and tmp11

Part 2 Objective: I am trying to break this decoder now. Inject bit inversions (errors) between the encoder and the decoder in viterbi_tx_rx*.sv. I made a new version for each test. 

Test the robustness of my design. Create a table of number of errors injected, patterns of errors injected, and number of errors uncorrected. 

2.a) Try various channel bit error patterns of rate of 1/16:

2.a.1) Invert bit[0] of the channel once every 8 samples.   

2.a.2) Repeat for bit[1].

2.a.3) Repeat with bit 0 and 1 both inverted once every 16 samples. 

2.a.4) Invert bit[0] twice in a row out of every 16 samples: 14 good, 2 bad, 14 good, 2 bad, â€¦ .

2.a.5) Repeat for bit[1]

2.a.6) Invert bit[0] four times in a row out of every 32 samples. 

2.a.7) Repeat for bit[1]

2.a.8) Invert bits 1 and 0 twice in a row out of every 32 samples.

2.b) Using the $random function, devise randomized versions of the above tests.  

2.c) How long a string of consecutive bad bit[0]s is needed to produce output errors?

2.d) Repeat for bad bit[1].

2.e) Repeat for bit [1] and [0] both.
